# MyMoney Personal Finance Analysis

## **Executive Summary**
The dataset was exported into CSV from MyMoney app which is a financial tracker in mobile phone. Using Excel and Python, I performed data cleaning and visualization to find patterns and highlight the results. The analysis shows that my expenses monthly is in between 3k to 8.5k, I spend mostly on food and shopping, lastly I my income is slightly higher with my expenses. My income is higher than my expenses. The resolution includes:

1. allocate budget per category 
2. since 5k is the benchmark, we can decrease more by spending less on each categories
3. pay attention to the Shopping categories, buy only the things that is needed


## **Statement of the Problem**
Managing personal finances has been a challenge, as I often struggled with untracked expenses that led to money losses each month. To address this, I used the MyMoney app to record my income and expenses allowing me to analyze my financial behavior more systematically.

### **Objectives:**
1. Understand my spending patterns over the period May 2024 â€“ May 2025.
2. Identify the categories where I spend the most.
3. Compare Income and Expenses to evaluate financial balance.

## **Methodology**
* I cleaned and standardized the data using Excel. I also utilized sort and filter feature to eliminate and modified sketchy data from the dataset.
* I used Python (Pandas and Matplotlib) to perform an analysis and utilized graphs to visualize the result.

## **Skills**
* Excel - power query, sort and filter
* Python - Pandas, Matplotlib

## **Results**
Here's what I found out:
1. Spending habits - the analysis shows that in the entire year (May 2024 to May 2025), the expenses stays just in between 3k php to 8.5k php. The months where I spend the most are August,October of 2024 and January 2025. The average expenses is 5k.
2. I spend mostly on Food, Shopping, Tax, Telephone and Transportation 
3. During this period, about 47% of the money went to expenses while 53% came from income, showing that income slightly outweighed expenses by 6%.

## **Recommendations**
My recommendation for myself is to:
*  allocate budget per category 
* since 5k is the benchmark, we can decrease more by spending less on each categories
* pay attention to the Shopping categories, buy only the things that is needed
